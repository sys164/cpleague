  Thank you for your interest in our league.  Because of the social distancing restrictions in place, we are currently developing an online registration system.  This can be accessed via the login/register button.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">
  The application process is a two stage process.  An initial registration including club name and details of your secretary.  Once this has been received by the league committee, login details will be provided that then allow for teams and coaches to be listed. The details of these will then be passed to the age group secretaries.
